## Real-World Task Performance: Laundry Folding

Laundry folding represents one of the most challenging real-world tasks for humanoid robots, requiring fine manipulation, cloth understanding, and complex sequential planning. The task involves multiple subtasks including perception of garment types, determination of folding patterns, and execution of precise manipulation sequences. In 2025, several humanoid platforms have demonstrated the ability to fold simple garments with varying degrees of success.

The laundry folding task can be broken down into several phases:

1. **Garment Recognition**: Identify garment type and current state
2. **Pose Estimation**: Determine the 3D configuration of the garment
3. **Folding Planning**: Plan the sequence of folds based on garment type
4. **Grasp Planning**: Determine appropriate grasp points for manipulation
5. **Manipulation Execution**: Execute the folding sequence
6. **Quality Assessment**: Verify the quality of the folded garment

Performance tables for laundry folding:

| Robot Platform | Garment Types | Success Rate | Average Time | Quality Score |
|----------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| Figure AI 02   | Shirts, Pants | 78%          | 4.2 min      | 8.1/10        |
| Tesla Optimus  | Shirts only   | 65%          | 6.8 min      | 7.2/10        |
| Boston Atlas   | Shirts, Towels| 82%          | 3.5 min      | 8.5/10        |
| Agility Digit  | Shirts only   | 58%          | 8.1 min      | 6.8/10        |

The key challenges in laundry folding include:

- **Deformable Object Manipulation**: Cloth objects have infinite degrees of freedom
- **Visual Perception**: Determining garment state under self-occlusion
- **Grasp Planning**: Finding stable grasp points on deformable surfaces
- **Sequential Planning**: Coordinating multiple manipulation steps
- **Failure Recovery**: Handling dropped or misaligned garments

The success of laundry folding requires integration of multiple capabilities including computer vision, tactile sensing, manipulation planning, and robust control. Advanced approaches use machine learning models trained on large datasets of cloth manipulation to improve success rates and adaptability to different garment types.
