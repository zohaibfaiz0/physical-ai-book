## Glossary

**Affordance**: The property of an object that defines how it can be used or interacted with in a specific environment.

**Embodied AI**: Artificial intelligence systems that exist and operate in physical environments, interacting with the real world through sensors and actuators.

**Forward Kinematics**: The process of determining the position and orientation of a robot's end-effector based on joint angles.

**Inverse Kinematics**: The process of determining the joint angles required to achieve a desired end-effector position and orientation.

**Locomotion**: The ability of a robot to move from one location to another, typically referring to walking, rolling, or crawling.

**Manipulation**: The ability of a robot to interact with objects in its environment, typically through grasping, moving, or modifying objects.

**Perception Pipeline**: The sequence of processing steps that convert raw sensor data into meaningful information about the environment.

**Reactive Control**: A control strategy that responds directly to sensor inputs without maintaining an internal model of the world.

**SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: The computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it.

**Teleoperation**: Remote control of a robot by a human operator, often with haptic feedback.

**VLA (Vision-Language-Action) Models**: AI models that integrate visual perception, language understanding, and physical action execution in a unified framework.

**Whole-Body Control**: A control approach that considers the entire robot as a single system, optimizing all joint movements simultaneously for optimal performance.
