### Cloud Alternative Specifications

| Service | Instance Type | GPU | CPU/RAM | Storage | Monthly Cost* |
|---------|---------------|-----|---------|---------|---------------|
| AWS | g5.2xlarge | 1x A10G (24GB) | 8 vCPU, 32GB | 125GB NVMe | ~$1,200 |
| AWS | g5.4xlarge | 1x A10G (24GB) | 16 vCPU, 64GB | 250GB NVMe | ~$1,600 |
| AWS | g5.8xlarge | 1x A10G (24GB) | 32 vCPU, 128GB | 500GB NVMe | ~$2,400 |
| Azure | NC A10 v3 | 1x A10 (24GB) | 12 vCPU, 112GB | 384GB NVMe | ~$1,400 |
| GCP | g2-standard-8 | 1x L4 (24GB) | 8 vCPU, 32GB | 1x 375GB SSD | ~$1,100 |

*Costs are approximate and may vary based on region and usage patterns.

## Edge Computing Kits

For robot deployment and real-world testing, we recommend the following edge computing solutions:

| Kit | Model | GPU | CPU/RAM | Sensors | Price Range |
|-----|-------|-----|---------|---------|-------------|
| Basic Edge | NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano | 40-core Ada GPU | 4-core ARM, 4GB | - | $400-500 |
| Standard Edge | Jetson Orin NX | 1024-core Ampere GPU | 6-core ARM, 8GB | - | $400-500 |
| Advanced Edge | Jetson Orin AGX | 2048-core Ampere GPU | 8-core ARM, 32GB | - | $1,500-2,000 |
| Complete Kit | Orin Nano + RealSense D435i | 40-core Ada GPU | 4-core ARM, 4GB | Depth camera, IMU | $650-750 |

## Robot Platforms

Various robot platforms are suitable for different aspects of the course:

| Platform | Type | Degrees of Freedom | Payload | Price Range | Use Case |

## Economy Kit Option

For students on a tight budget, we offer an alternative "Economy Kit" that allows participation in most course activities:

- **Cloud-based development**: Use AWS g5.2xlarge instances ($1,200/month) for heavy computation
- **Simulation-focused**: Emphasize Isaac Sim and Gazebo rather than physical hardware
- **Shared hardware**: Access to university/college robotics labs
- **Component-by-component**: Purchase hardware modules as needed for specific projects
- **Open-source alternatives**: Use free simulation environments and community hardware

This approach allows students to learn the core concepts of Physical AI without the full hardware investment, with the option to add physical hardware later as resources allow.

## Additional Requirements

- **Network infrastructure**: Reliable WiFi 6 or Ethernet for robot communication
- **Power systems**: UPS for critical development hardware
- **Workshop space**: Adequate space for robot testing and development
- **Safety equipment**: Emergency stop mechanisms, safety barriers for testing
